## Application Prep

**Prerequisites** Install this application on a server with Node.js and Express.js already installed.

In the Top Level Folder
- `npm install --save-dev concurrently`

In the /client directory
- `npm install @apollo-client graphql jwt-decode

In the /server directory
- `npm install --save-dev nodemon`
- `npm install apollo-server-express bcrypt express graphql jsonwebtoken mongoose`

**NOTE** The above steps were used to install dependencies during app development.  These steps should *not* be necessary to install and run this application.  See *installation* steps below for setting up the application for your own use.

## Installation

After you clone the repository...

- From the top Level older, open a terminal window and run `npm run install`.  This will install all dependencies for the top level, as well as the /client and /server.

- From the same location, run `npm run develop` to start both client and server applications simultaneously in Development mode.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
